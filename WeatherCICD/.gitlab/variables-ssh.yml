# ============================================================
# SSH Deployment Variables Configuration
# ============================================================
# Define SSH-specific variables for secure deployments
# These variables are used when running the pipeline manually for SSH deployment
# Make sure to keep sensitive information secure and use masked variables where appropriate

variables:
  SSH_USER:
    value: "secure_ssh_deploy_user"
    description: "SSH user for secure deployments (ensure this user has minimal access with deploy permissions)."
  
  SSH_PASS:
    value: ""
    description: "SSH password (use CI/CD masked variables for production for better security)."
  
  SSH_DEPLOY_DIRECTORY:
    value: "/var/www/html"
    description: "SSH server directory path where the files will be deployed (adjust for your server setup)."
  
  SSH_PRODUCTION_SERVER:
    value: "production-server.example.com"
    description: "SSH server hostname, URL, or IP address for deployment and health checks (e.g., 'example.com')."
